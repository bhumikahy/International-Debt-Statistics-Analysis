# International Debt Statistics Data Analysis - Postgres SQL

## Project Description
It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries. 

In this project, we analyze the international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.

The objective is to analyze several key questions, such as: 
1. The World Bank's international debt data.
2. Finding the number of distinct countries.
3. Find out the distinct debt indicators.
4. Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries.
5. Country with the highest debt.
6. Average amount of debt across indicators.
7. The highest amount of principal repayments.
8. The most common debt indicator.
9. Other viable debt issues and conclusion.
